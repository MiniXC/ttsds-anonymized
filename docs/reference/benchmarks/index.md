# Benchmarks Overview

This section contains documentation for the benchmark classes in TTSDS.

The benchmarks are organized into several categories:

- Speaker benchmarks: Evaluate speaker identity preservation
- Intelligibility benchmarks: Measure speech recognition performance
- Prosody benchmarks: Assess speech rhythm and intonation
- Generic benchmarks: General speech quality metrics
- Environment benchmarks: Noise robustness evaluation

Each benchmark class extends the base `Benchmark` class and implements specific methods for feature extraction and score calculation.
